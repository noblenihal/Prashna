"
The order of decreasing reactivity towards an electrophilic reagent, for the following : (i) Benzene (ii) Toluene (iii) Chlorobenzene (iv) Phenol would be:;(a) (i) > (ii) > (iii) > (iv);(b) (ii) > (iv) > (i) > (iii);(c) (iv) > (iii) > (ii) > (i);(d) (iv) > (ii) > (i) > (iii);"(d) (iv) > (ii) > (i) > (iii)
Explanation:
Benzene having any activating group i.e., OH, R etc., undergoes electrophilic substitution very easily as compared to benzene itself. Thus toluene (C6H5CH3), phenol (C6H5OH) undergo electrophilic substitution very readily than benzene. Chlorine with +E and +M effect deactivates the ring due to strong -I effect. So, it is difficult to carry out the substitution in chlorobenzene than in benzene, so correct order is Phenol (iv) > Toluene (ii) > Benzene (i) > Chlorobenzene (iii)"
