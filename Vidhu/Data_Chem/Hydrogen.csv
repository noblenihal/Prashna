The volume strength of 1.5 NH2O2 solution is :;(a) 4.8;(b) 5.2;(c) 8.8;(d) 8.4;"(d) 8.4
Explanation:
Strength =Normality ×Equivalent Weight of H2O2
= 1.5N × 1.7gL-1 = 25.5gL-1
2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2
68g 22400 mLat STP
68 g of H2O gives = 22400 mL of O2 at STP
25.5 gH2O2 gives = 2240068 × 25.5 = 8400 mL of O2 at STP
25.5g of H2O2 is present in 1000 mL of H2O2 solution
1000 mL of H2O2 gives 8400 mL of O2 at STP
1 mL of H2O2 gives 84001000 mL of O2 at STP
= 8.4mL of O2
Hence, volume strength of 1.5NH2O2 = 8.4 volume.
Or mass of H2O2 in 1.5N solution
= Equivalent Weight of H2O2 × 1.5N
= 17 × 1.5 = 25.5 g/L
Hence, volume strength of 1.5NH2O2 solution
= 22.4 × 25.568 = 8.4"
Water gas is mixture of hydrogen H2 and;(a) CO;(b) CO2;(c) Cl2;(d) SO2;"(a) CO
Explanation:
Water gas is a combustion fuel containing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H2). Water gas is made by passing steam over heated hydrocarbons."
Hydrogen has isotopes;(a) 2;(b) 3;(c) 4;(d) 5;"(c) 4
Explanation:
Hydrogen has three main isotopes; Protium (1H), deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H). These isotopes form naturally in nature. Protium and deuterium are stable. Tritium is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12 years. Scientists have created four other hydrogen isotopes (4H to 7H), but these isotopes are very unstable and do not exist naturally.
The main isotopes of hydrogen are unique because they are the only isotopes that have a name."
The freezing point of heavy water is;(a) 0°C;(b) 3.8°C;(c) 4°C;(d) 1°C;(b) 3.8°C

_________________ on water decolourises H2O2;(a) O3;(b) Acidic KMnO4 solution;(c) Black Suspension of Lead Sulphide(PbS);(d) None of these.;"(c) Black Suspension of Lead Sulphide(PbS)
Explanation:
Lead sulphide (black suspension) on reaction with hydrogen peroxide forms lead sulphate and water. Lead sulphate as well as water are colourless, therefore lead sulphite decolourises on addition of hydrogen peroxide.
PbS(s) + 4H2O2 (aq) → PbSO4 (s) + 4H2O (aq)"
What is gram equivalent weight of hydrogen peroxide as reductant?;(a) 100;(b) 125;(c) 152;(d) None of the Above;"(c) 152
Explanation:
As reductant hydrogen peroxide oxidises to oxygen. H2O2 → O2
​The change in oxidation number is 2
The molar mass = 34 g
Gram equivalent weight of H2O2 = (\(\frac{34}{2}\))
​= 17 g
Equivalent weight = 152"
Hydrogen is the most abundant element on earth after______.;(a) Oxygen;(b) Carbon;(c) Sulphur;(d) None of the Above;"(a) Oxygen
Explanation:
The mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earths crust is approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminium 8.2%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium, 2.0%, and titanium 0 .61%.

A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen. The electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75% of the baryonic mass of the universe."
Hydrogen is a good __________ agent.;(a) Oxidizing;(b) Reducing;(c) Acidic;(d) Basic;"(b) Reducing
Explanation:
Hydrogen acts as a good reducing agent means, when hydrogen gas is passed over hot metallic oxides of copper, lead, iron, etc. it removes oxygen from them and thus reduces them to their corresponding metal. Let us consider the following example, in each of which metallic oxide react with hydrogen. Metallic oxide act as oxidizing agents and hydrogen acts as a reducing agent.

The volume of 10 volume H2O2 required to liberate 500 ml of O2 at S.T.P. is :;(a) 25 ml;(b) 50 ml;(c) 100 ml;(d) 125 ml;"(b) 50 ml
Explanation:
As 10 ml of oxygen is obtained at STP from H2O2 = 1 ml
Therefore, 500 ml of O2 is obtained at STP = 50 ml"
Hydrogen is most __________ element in the universe.;(a) Abundant;(b) None;(c) Both;(d) Consumer;"(a) Abundant
Explanation:
Hydrogen is considered as the most common and abundant element. The element Hydrogen has only one proton and one electron and is the only element which has no neutrons. Therefore it is considered as the simplest element in the universe and gives a valid reason for it to be the most abundant and common element in the universe. As per estimation from the Jefferson Lab, approximately 90 percent of the visible universe is framed by Hydrogen proving that being in the simplest form, this element is the most common and abundant element in the universe."
