Explanation:
Vapour pressure depends on T only and it does not depend on container volume."

Explanation:
The vapour pressure of the liquid is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the intermolecular forces of attraction present. Based on this, the liquid with higher vapour pressure in the different pairs is: (a) Alcohol, (b) Petrol, (c) Water."
The state of matter that shows the uniformity of behavior :;(a) Solid Liquid;(b) Liquid;(c) Gas;(d) None of the Above;"(c) Gas
Explanation:
Of the three states of matter, the gaseous state is the simplest and shows greatest uniformity in behaviour. Gases show almost similar behaviour irrespective of their chemical nature. This state is characterized by:
Gases maintain neither the volume nor the shape. They completely fill the container in which they are placed."
A gas deviates from ideal behavior at a high pressure because its molecules:;(a) Attract one another;(b) Show the Tyndall Effect;(c) Have kinetic energy;(d) Are bound by covalent bonds;"(a) Attract one another
Explanation:
The basic concept of the kinetic-molecular theory give us the information why real gases deviate from ideal behavior. The molecules of an ideal gas are assumed to occupy no space and have no attractions for one another. Real molecules, however, do have finite volumes, and they do attract one another. So, a gas deviates from ideal behavior at a high pressure because its molecules attract one another."
The value of universal gas constant R depends on;(a) Temperature of Gas;(b) Volume of Gas;(c) Number of Moles of Gas;(d) Units of Volume,Temperature and Pressure;"(d) Units of Volume,Temperature and Pressure
Explanation:
The value of the gas constant R depends on the units used for pressure, volume and temperature."
The critical volumes of four gases A, B, C, D are respectively 0.025 L, 0.312 L, 0.245 L, 0.432 L, the gas with highest value of van der Wall constant b is;(a) A;(b) B;(c) C;(d) D;"(d) D
Explanation:
Vc = 3b = 3 × 4N × (4/3) πr³"
Which of the following statement is wrong for gases?;(a) Gases do not have definite shape and volume;(b) Volume of the gas is equal to the volume of the container confining the gas;(c) Confined gas exert uniform pressure on the wall of the container in all directions;(d) Mass of the gas cannot be determined by weighing a container in which it is contained;"(d) Mass of the gas cannot be determined by weighing a container in which it is contained
Explanation:
Mass of the gas = mass of the cylinder including gas – mass of empty cylinder. So mass of a gas can be determined by weighing the container in which it is enclosed. Thus, the statement (d) is wrong for gases."
In van der Waal equation of state of gas laws, the constant b is a measure of;(a) Intermolecular collisions per unit volume;(b) Intermolecular attraction;(c) Volume occupied by the molecules;(d) Intermolecular repulsions;"(c) Volume occupied by the molecules
Explanation:
In van der Waals equation of state of the gas law, the constant b is a measure of the volume occupied by the molecules. It gives the effective size of the gas molecules. The greater value of b indicates a larger size of the molecules and smaller compressible volume."
The volume of 2.8 g of carbon monoxide at 27°C and 0.0821 atm is;(a) 30 L;(b) 3 L;(c) 0.3 L;(d) 1.5 L;"(a) 30 L
Explanation:
According to the ideal gas equation, we have
PV = nRT
​PV = (\(\frac {w}{M}\)) RT
​V = ​ (\(\frac {w}{M}\)) (\(\frac {RT}{P}\))
Given values are:
w = 2.8 g
M = Molar mass of CO = 28 g mol-1
T = 27°C = (273 + 27) = 300 K
P = 0.821 atm
R = 0.0821 L atm mol-1 K-1
Putting the values in the formula we get :
V = (2.8 g /28 g mol-1) × (0.0821 L atm mol-1 K-1) × (300 K)/(0.821 atm)
= 3 L"

Explanation:
At constant T, P1V1 = P2V2
1 × 20 = P2 × 50;
P2 = (\(\frac {20}{ 50}\)) × 1"
How many of the know elements exist as gases at 25°C?;(a) 9;(b) 11;(c) 12;(d) 15;(b) 11
The states of matter having no definite shape but definite volume:;(a) Gas;(b) Liquid;(c) Solid;(d) None of the Above;"(b) Liquid
Explanation:
In a liquid, particles will flow or glide over one another, but stay toward the bottom of the container. The attractive forces between particles are strong enough to hold a specific volume but not strong enough to keep the molecules sliding over each other."
The rise or fall of a liquid within a tube of small bore is called:;(a) Surface Tension;(b) Capillary Action;(c) Viscosity;(d) Formation of Curvature;"(b) Capillary Action
Explanation:
Capillarity, rise or depression of a liquid in a small passage such as a tube of small cross-sectional area, like the spaces between the fibres of a towel or the openings in a porous material. Capillarity is not limited to the vertical direction. Water is drawn into the fibres of a towel, no matter how the towel is oriented."
The theory which explains that gases consist of molecules, which are in rapid option is known as:;(a) Daltons Atomic Theory;(b) Bohrs Theory;(c) Rutherfords Atomic Theory;(d) Kinetic Molecular Theory;"(d) Kinetic Molecular Theory
Explanation:
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term “molecule” will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)"
Falling drop of water is spherical due to:;(a) Hydrogen Bonding;(b) Surface Tension;(c) Capillary Action;(d) Vlscosity;"(b) Surface Tension
Explanation:
Raindrops take up the spherical shape due to the surface tension of water which is caused due to the tendency of water molecules to stick together. The spherical shape is having the least possible surface area due to which it can resist any of the external force in the atmosphere."
The rates of diffusion of gases are inversely proportional to square root of their densities . This statement refers to :;(a) Daltons Law;(b) Grahams Law;(c) Avogadros Law;(d) None of the Above;"(b) Grahams Law
Explanation:
Grahams law states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. In the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the molar mass is proportional to the mass density. Therefore the rate of diffusion of different gases is inversely proportional to the square root of their mass densities.

and r α (\(\sqrt{\frac {1}{M}}\))"
The law, which states that at constant temperature, the volume of a given mass of gas is inversely proportional is pressure, is known as:;(a) Boyles law;(b) Charles law;(c) Combine gas law;(d) Avogadros law;"(a) Boyles law
Explanation:
In 1662 Robert Boyle studied the relationship between volume and pressure of a gas of fixed amount at constant temperature. He observed that volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature. Boyles law, published in 1662, states that, at constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an ideal gas in a closed system is always constant. It can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container. It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.
A statement of Boyles law is as follows:
The volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to pressure when the temperature is constant.​
V ∝ (\(\frac {1}{P}\)) meaning “Volume is inversely proportional to Pressure”, or
P ∝ (\(\frac {1}{V}\)) meaning “Pressure is inversely proportional to Volume”, or
where P is the pressure, and V is the volume of a gas, and k1 is the constant in this equation."
If helium and methane are allowed to diffuse out of the container under the similar conditions of temperature and pressure, then the ratio of rate of diffusion of helium to methane is:;(a) 2 : 1;(b) 1 : 2;(c) 3 : 5;(d) 4 : 1;"(a) 2 : 1
Explanation:
According to Grahams law
(\(\frac {r_1}{r_2}\)) = (\(\sqrt{\frac {M_1}{M_2}}\))
(rHe/rCH4) = (\(\sqrt{\frac {16}{4}}\))
= (\(\frac {1}{2}\))"
When you heat a sample of gas, what happens to the particles that make up the gas?;(a) The particles move faster.;(b) The particles break apart;(c) The particles get smaller;(d) The particles become more dense;"(a) The particles move faster.
Explanation:
There is a great deal of empty space between particles, which have a lot of kinetic energy. The particles move very fast and collide into one another when the gas is heated up, causing them to diffuse, or spread out, until they are evenly distributed throughout the volume of the container."
