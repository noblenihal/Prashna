0.0833mol of carbohydrate of empirical formula CH2O contain 1g of hydrogen. The molecular formula of the carbohydrate is;(a) C5H10O5;(b) C3H4O3;(c) C12H22O11;(d) C6H12O6;"(d) C6H12O6
Explanation:
As 0.0833 mole carbohydrate has hydrogen = 1g
Therefore, 1 mole carbohydrate has hydrogen = (\(\frac {1}{0.0833}\)) = 12g
Empirical Formula (CH2O) has hydrogen = 2g
Hence n = \(\frac {(12)}{(2)}\) = 6
Hence molecular formula of carbohydrate =(CH2O)6 = C6H12O6"

Explanation:
Minimum mass of sulphur = wt. of its one atom = 32
As 3.4 gms of sulphur present in 100 gms.
Therefore, 32 gms of sulphur present in = (100 × 32)/(3.4) = 940"

"
In the Dumas method, the nitrogen present in organic compound gets converted to;(a) Sodium Cyanide;(b) Gaseoue Ammonia;(c) Dinitrogen Gas;(d) Ammonium Sulphate.;"(c) Dinitrogen Gas
Explanation:
Nitrogen present in the organic compound is converted into N2 gas by heating the compound with CuO."
0.0833mol of carbohydrate of empirical formula CH2O contain 1 g of hydrogen. The molecular formula of the carbohydrate is;(a) C5H10O5;(b) C3H4O3;(c) C12H22O11;(d) C6H12O6;"(d) C6H12O6
Explanation:
As 0.0833 mole carbohydrate has hydrogen = 1 g
Therefore, 1 mole carbohydrate has hydrogen = (\(\frac {1}{0.0833}\)) = 12 g
Empirical Formula (CH2O) has hydrogen = 2 g
Hence n = \(\frac {(12)}{(2)}\) = 6
Hence molecular formula of carbohydrate = (CH2O)6 = C6H12O6"
The compound  is known by which of the following names;(a) Bicyclo-[2, 2, 2] octane;(b) Bicyclo-[2, 2, 1] octane;(c) Bicyclo-[1, 2, 1] octane;(d) Bicyclo-[1, 1, 1] octane;"(a) Bicyclo-[2, 2, 2] octane
Explanation:

"
Which one of the following conformations of cyclohexane is chiral?;(a) Twist boat;(b) Rigid;(c) Chair;(d) Boat;"(a) Twist boat
Explanation:
The twist boat conformation of cyclohexane is optically active as it does not have any plane of symmetry.

If 0.228 g of silver salt of dibasic acid gave a residue of 0.162 g of silver on ignition then molecular weight of the acid is;(a) 70;(b) 80;(c) 90;(d) 100;"(c) 90
Explanation:
Mass of silver salt taken = 0.228 gm
Mass of silver left = 0.162 gm
Basicity of acid = 2
Step 1- To calculate the equivalent mass of the silver salt (Eq. mass of silver salt)/(Eq. mass of silver)=(Mass of Acid taken)/(Mass of silver left)
(\(\frac {E}{108}\)) = (\(\frac {0.228}{0.162}\))
E = (\(\frac {0.228}{0.162}\)) × 108 = 152(Eq. mass of silver salt)
Step 2 – To calculate the eq. mass of acid = ( Equivalent mass of acid)
= Equivalent mass of silver salt – Equivalent mass of Ag + Basicity
= 152 – 108 + 1
= 152 – 109
= 43 (Equivalent mass of acid)
Step 3- To determine the molecular mass of acid. molecular mass of the acid = Equivalent mass of acid × basicity = 45 × 2 = 90."
If there is no rotation of plane polarized light by a compound in a specific solvent, thought to be chiral, it may mean that;(a) The compound may be a racemic mixture;(b) The compound is certainly a chiral;(c) The compound is certainly meso;(d) There is no compound in the solvent.;"(c) The compound is certainly meso
Explanation:
Meso compound does not rotate plane polarised light. Compound which contains tetrahedral atoms with four different groups but the whole molecule is a chiral, is known as meso compound. It possesses a plane of symmetry and is optically inactive. One of the asymmetric carbon atoms turns the plane of polarised light to the right and other to the left and to the same extent so that the rotation due to upper half is compensated by the lower half, i.e., internally compensated, and finally there is no rotation of plane polarised light."

Which of the following behaves both as a nucleophile and as an electrophile?;(a) CH3C ≡ N;(b) CH3OH;(c) CH2 = CHCH3;(d) CH3NH2;"(a) CH3C ≡ N
Explanation:
Due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on N, CH3C ≡ N: acts as a nucleophile. Further due to greater electronegativity of N than C, the C atom of −C ≡ N carries a positive charge and hence behaves as an electrophile."
