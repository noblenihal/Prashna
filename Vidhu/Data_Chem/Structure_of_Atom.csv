A gas absorbs a photon of 355 nm and emits at two wavelengths. If one of the emissions is at 680 nm, the other is at:;(a) 518 nm;(b) 1035 nm;(c) 325 nm;(d) 743 nm;"(d) 743 nm
Explanation:
From Law of Conservation of energy, energy of absorbed photon must be equal to combined energy of two emitted photons.
ET = E1 + E2 ….. (1)
Where E1 is Energy of first emitted photon emitted and E2is Energy of second emitted photon.
Energy E and wavelength λ of a photon are related by the equation
E= (hc)/ (λ)….. (2)
Where Plancks constant = h, c is velocity of light.
Substituting the values from (2) in (1) we get
(hc/λT) = (hc)/ (λ1) + (hc)/ (λ2)
Or (\(\frac{1}{λ_T}\)) = (\(\frac{1}{λ_1}\)) + (\(\frac{1}{λ_2}\)) …… (3)
Substituting given values in (3) we get
(\(\frac{1}{355}\)) = (\(\frac{1}{680}\)) + (\(\frac{1}{λ_2}\))
Or \(\frac{(1)}{(λ_T)}\) = (\(\frac{1}{355}\)) − (\(\frac{1}{680}\))
⇒ (\(\frac{1}{λ_2}\)) = (680 − 355)/ (355 × 680)
⇒ λ2 = 742.77nm"

The electrons of the same orbitals can be distinguished by;(a) Principal quantum number;(b) Azimuthal quantum number;(c) Spin quantum number;(d) Magnetic quantum number;"(c) Spin quantum number
Explanation:
Electrons occupying the same orbital are distinguished by Spin quantum number.
For spin Quantum number it has two values +1/2 or -1/2,
Hence the value of n, l , m are same for the two electrons occupying in the same orbitals, but only the is different, which is
Therefore, Spin quantum number explains the direction through which the electron spins in an orbital. so obviously there are only 2 possible directions. Which is either clockwise or anticlockwise.
So the electron which are available in the same orbitals, must have opposite spins. Hence spin quantum number distinguished b/w the two electrons."
