0,0.0,The oxidation number of Cl in Cl2O7 is,(a) + 7,(b) + 5,(c) + 3,(d) – 7,"(a) + 7
Explanation:
Cl show different oxidation state as -1 to +7 due to vacant d orbital. As oxygen is more electronegative than Cl. Oxygen size is small hence its more electronegative and show -2 oxidation states.
Here Cl2O7 then equation is: 2x + 7 × (-2) = 0
x = +7 hence oxidation state of Cl is +7. I think you get your answer how to find oxidation state.",reactive
1,1.0,What is known as Autooxidation?,(a) Formation of H2O by the oxidation of H2O2.,(b) Formation of H2O2 by the oxidation of H2O.,(c) Both (1) and (2) are true,(d) None of the above,"(b) Formation of H2O2 by the oxidation of H2O.
Explanation:
Autoxidation is any oxidation that occurs in presence of oxygen. The term is usually used to describe the degradation of organic compounds in air (as a source of oxygen). Autoxidation produces hydroperoxides and cyclic organic peroxides. These species can react further to form many products. The process is relevant to many phenomena including aging, paint, and spoilage of foods, degradation of petrochemicals, and the industrial production of chemicals. Autoxidation is important because it is a useful reaction for converting compounds to oxygenated derivatives, and also because it occurs in situations where it is not desired (as in the destructive cracking of the rubber in automobile tires or in rancidification).",kmnonalso
2,2.0,The tendency of an electrode to lose electrons is known as,(a) Electrode Potential,(b) Reduction Potential,(c) Oxidation Potential,(d) E.M.F.,"(c) Oxidation Potential
Explanation:
The magnitude of the electrode potential of a metal is a measure of its relative tendency to lose or gain electrons. i.e., it is a measure of the relative tendency to undergo oxidation (loss of electrons) or reduction (gain of electrons).

3,3.0,If equal volumes of 1M KMnO4 and 1M K2Cr2O7 solutions are allowed to oxidize Fe2+ in acidic medium. The amount of iron oxidized will be:,(a) More with KMnO2,(b) More with K2Cr2O7,(c) Equal with both oxidising agents,(d) Cannot be determined,"(b) More with K2Cr2O7
Explanation:
The reason due to which the amount of Fe oxidised will be more with ​K2Cr2O7 is:
the change in the oxidation state (or number) or n factor is greater with KMnO4
Also, ​K2Cr2O7 is a very strong oxidising agent and holds the ability to take the electrons but ​KMnO4 is more stronger than ​K2Cr2O7.",four

5,5.0,"One mole of N2H4 loses ten moles of electrons to form a new compound A. Assuming that all the nitrogen appears in the new compound, what is the oxidation state of nitrogen in A? (There is no change in the oxidation state of hydrogen.)",(a) -1,(b) -3,(c) +3,(d) +5,"(c) +3
Explanation:
First to find oxidation number of Nitrogen in N2H4
Oxidation number of H = +1
Let oxidation number of nitrogen be x
2x + 4(1) = 0
2x = -4
x = -2
Each nitrogen atom has -2 oxidation number. So taken both nitrogen atoms in account gives oxidation number -4.
Change in oxidation number of nitrogen on losing 10 mol of electrons (considering no change in oxidation number of hydrogen atoms)
-4 – (-10) = +6
Therefore, oxidation number of 2 nitrogen atoms in compound Y is +6. Hence, oxidation number of each nitrogen atom will be +3 in new compound Y.",loss
6,6.0,How many millilitres of 0.5 M H2SO4 are needed to dissolve 0.5 g of copper(II)carbonate?,(a) 6.01,(b) 4.5,(c) 8.1,(d) 11.1,"(c) 8.1
Explanation:
The volume can be calculated :
N1V1 = N2V2
N1 = Normality of H2SO4 = 0.5 × 2 = 1 N
V1 = Volume of H2SO4
Molar mass of copper(II) carbonate = 123.5 g
N2 = Normality of copper (II) carbonate = (0.5×2)/(123.5) N
V2 = Volume of copper (II) carbonate = 1000 mL
So, after applying the formula,
1 × V1 = (0.5×2)/(123.5)×1000
Hence, V1 = 8.09 mL
= approx. 8.1 mL",

9,9.0,The number of moles of KMnO4 reduced by one mole of KI in alkaline medium is,(a) One,(b) Two,(c) Five,(d) One fifth.,"(b) Two
Explanation:
In alkaline medium the reduction of KMnO4 with KI will takes place as
2 KMnO4 + H2O → 2 KOH + 2 MnO2
KI + 3[O] → KIO3
Hence the overall reaction is
KI + 2KMnO4 + H2O → KIO3 + 2 KOH + 2 MnO2
So, one mole of KI will reduced two moles of KMnO4",isnthe

Explanation:
In VO2+ →V2​O3, V is reduced from +4 to +3 oxidation state.
In Na → Na2+, Na is oxidised from to +1 oxidation state.
In CrO4-2​ → Cr2O7-2, Cr remains in same oxidation state +6.

Explanation:
2MnO4– + 5C2O42- + 16H+ → 2Mn2+ + 10CO2 + 8H2O
Therefore, 2 moles of MNO4– equivalent to 5 moles of C2O42-

16,16.0,Metals generally react with dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas. Which one of the following metals does not react with dilute hydrochloric acid?,(a) Copper,(b) Magnesium,(c) Iron,(d) Silver,"(b) Magnesium
Explanation:
Most of the metals such as Al, Cu, Fe etc. reacts with dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas but magnesium is an exception. Magnesium being an active metal liberates dihydrogen gas as it is allowed to react with dilute HCl. Thus all the given metals react with dilute acids.
Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2",nin
17,17.0,The oxidation number of Xe in BaXeO6 is,(a) 8,(b) 6,(c) 4,(d) 10,"(d) 10
Explanation:
Oxidation state of Ba in general = +2 and of O = −2
Applying formula, Sum of total oxidation state of all atoms = Overall charge on the compound.
Let oxidation state of Xe in BaXeO6 be x.
2 + x + 6(−2) = 0,
x = 10
But oxidation state 10 is not possible for Xe. In this case the oxidation state of Xe is equal to maximum possible oxidation state for Xe = +8.",determined

Explanation:
When copper turnings are added to silver nitrate solution, the solution becomes brown in color after sometime because copper is more reactive than silver so it displaces silver from silver nitrate solution and form copper nitrate solution.",
19,19.0,"A standard reduction electrode potentials of four metals are A = -0.250 V, B = -0.140 V, C = -0.126 V, D = -0.402 V The metal that displaces A from its aqueous solution is:",(a) A,(b) B,(c) C,(d) D,"(d) D
Explanation:
Reduction potential of D is minimum i.e. −0.402 V. Thus oxidation potential of D is maximum i.e. to +0.402 V. D can oxidise itself and reduce other.
The aqueous solution A will be present in its ionic form and can be reduced by D as its reduction potential is higher than D.
Thus D can replace A from its Aqueous solution.",millilitre
