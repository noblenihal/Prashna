0,0.0,The agricultural field that produces maximum methane gas into atmosphere is,(a) Wheat field,(b) Paddy field,(c) Cotton field,(d) Groundnut field,"(c) Cotton field
Explanation:
Rice is grown in flooded fields, a situation that depletes the soil of oxygen. Soils that are anaerobic (lacking oxygen) allow the bacteria that produce methane from decomposing organic matter to thrive. Some of this methane then bubbles to the surface, but most of it is diffused back into the atmosphere through the rice plants themselves. Hence, rice Paddy field that produces maximum methane gas into the atmosphere.",smog
1,1.0,"Fluorosis, the bone disease, is caused by the presence of",(a) Pesticides in water,(b) Fluorides in water,(c) Carbon monoxide in air,(d) Sulphur dioxide in air.,"(b) Fluorides in water
Explanation:
Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints.",creation
2,2.0,The most harmful air pollutant produced by automobiles is,(a) HNO3,(b) NO,(c) SO2,(d) CO.,"(d) CO.
Explanation:
Motor vehicle emissions contribute to air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities. Transportation contributes to more than half of the carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and almost a quarter of the hydrocarbons emitted into our air. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, toxic non-irritating gas. It is a product by incomplete combustion of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust is a major source of carbon monoxide.",polyhalogens
3,3.0,Which of the following is responsible for depletion of ozone layer in the upper strata of the atmosphere?,(a) Polyhalogens,(b) Ferrocene,(c) Fullerencs,(d) Freons.,"(d) Freons.
Explanation:
Fluorocarbons such as freon-1 (CFCl3) and freon-12 (CF2Cl2) emitted as propellants in aerosol spray cans, refrigerators, fire fighting reagents etc. are stable compounds and chemically inert. They do not react with any substance with which they come in contact and thus float through the atmosphere unchanged and eventually enter the stratosphere. There they absorb UV radiations and break down liberating free atomic chlorine which causes decomposition of ozone. This results in the depletion of the ozone layer.",reagent
4,4.0,Photochemical smog is related to pollution if,(a) Air,(b) Water,(c) Soil,(d) None of these,"(c) Soil
Explanation:
Photochemical smog is produced when pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels react with sunlight. The energy in the sunlight converts the pollutants into other toxic chemicals. For photochemical smog to form, there must be other pollutants in the air, specifically nitrous oxides and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",thermal
5,5.0,Which of the following acts as a sink for CO?,(a) Plants,(b) Haemoglobin,(c) Microorganisms present in the soil,(d) Oceans,"(c) Microorganisms present in the soil
Explanation:
CO is converted into CO2 by microorganism present in soil.",break
6,6.0,Domestic waste mostly constitutes,(a) Non-biodegradable pollution,(b) Biodegradable pollution,(c) Effluents,(d) Air pollution,"(b) Biodegradable pollution
Explanation:
Domestic waste mostly constitutes biodegradable pollution.",demand
7,7.0,Which is most harmful for life on globe?,(a) Deforestation,(b) Soil Erosion,(c) Increasing Desert,(d) Nuclear Fallout.,"(d) Nuclear Fallout.
Explanation:
Nuclear fallout, or simply fallout, is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear blast or a nuclear reaction conducted in an unshielded facility, so called because it “falls out” of the sky after the explosion and the shock wave have passed. While deforestation, soil erosion and increasing deserts can be controlled, nuclear fallout causes genetic mutation in humans and destruction that cannot be controlled or cured.",molecular
8,8.0,One of the following is the chief source of water and soil pollution,(a) Agro industry,(b) Mining,(c) Thermal power stations,(d) All of these,"(c) Thermal power stations
Explanation:
Thermal power plant, agro industry and mining all are responsible for soil and water pollution. (Due to extraction of chemicals which cause pollution)",exhaust
9,9.0,What is the indicator of pollution in water?,(a) Amount of oxygen,(b) Amount of hydrogen,(c) Amount of BOD,(d) Amount of nitrogen,"(c) Amount of BOD
Explanation:
The amount of oxygen required to break down a certain amount of organic matter is called the biological oxygen demand (BOD). The amount of BOD in water is an indicator of the level of pollution.",earth
10,10.0,Which of the following acts as a sink for CO?,(a) Plants,(b) Haemoglobin,(c) Microorganisms present in the soil,(d) Oceans,"(c) Microorganisms present in the soil
Explanation:
CO is converted into CO2 by microorganism present in soil.",rice
11,11.0,The false statement among the followings:,(a) The average residence time of NO is one month.,(b) Limestone acts as a sink for SOx.,(c) SOx can be removed from flue gases by passing through a solution of citrate ions.,(d) Ammonia acts as a sink for NOx.,"(d) Ammonia acts as a sink for NOx.
Explanation:
The average residence time of NO is 4 days.",photochemical
12,12.0,"A disease caused by eating fish contaminated by industrial waste, containing mercury compounds, is called as",(a) Minamata disease,(b) Brights disease,(c) Hashimotos disease,(d) Osteosclerosis,"(a) Minamata disease
Explanation:
Disease caused by eating fish found in water contaminated with industrial waste having mercury is minamata disease.",part
13,13.0,Which of the following is responsible for depletion of ozone layer in the upper strata of the atmosphere?,(a) Polyhalogens,(b) Ferrocene,(c) Fullerencs,(d) Freons.,"(d) Freons.

14,14.0,Photochemical smog is related to pollution if,(a) Air,(b) Water,(c) Soil,(d) None of these,"(c) Soil
Explanation:
Photochemical smog is produced when pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels react with sunlight. The energy in the sunlight converts the pollutants into other toxic chemicals. For photochemical smog to form, there must be other pollutants in the air, specifically nitrous oxides and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",mercury
15,15.0,Identify the wrong statement in the following:,(a) Acid rain is mostly because of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur,(b) Chlorofluorocarbons are responsible for ozone layer depltion,(c) Greenhouse effect is responsible for global warming,(d) Ozone layer does not permit infrared radiation from the sun to reach the earth.,"(d) Ozone layer does not permit infrared radiation from the sun to reach the earth.
Explanation:
Allotropes of Oxygen-
O2 (Dioxygen) and O3 (Ozone)
Infrared radiation is most important for heating up the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. These rays have high wavelength and low frequency and are not very harmful. Ozone does not hinder infrared radiation.",nonbiodegradable
16,16.0,Synthesis of ethanal commercially from which of the following reagent is the part of green chemistry?,(a) CH3CH2OH,(b) CH2 = CH2,(c) HC ≡ CH,(d) All of these,(b) CH2 = CH2,act
17,17.0,Which of the following is produced by a reaction of ultraviolet light?,(a) CO2,(b) SO2,(c) O3,(d) NO3,"(c) O3
Explanation:
Ultraviolet radiations cause photochemical splitting of oxygen molecules in the stratosphere. The nascent oxygen combines with molecular oxygen to form ozone. In troposphere nascent oxygen comes from nitrogen dioxide.",increasing
