Explanation:
An oxyacid, oxoacid, or ternary acid is an acid that contains oxygen. Specifically, it is a compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, with at least one hydrogen atom bond to oxygen that can dissociate to produce the H+ cation and the anion of the acid. e.g., carbonic acid, H2CO3 (OC(OH)2; sulphuric acid, H2SO4 (O2S(OH)2)."

Explanation:
The composition of gypsum is CaSO4 ∙2H2O. It does not have CaCO3"
Carnallite is the mineral of:;(a) Na;(b) Ca;(c) Mg;(d) None of the Above;"(c) Mg
Explanation:
Carnallite is an evaporite mineral a hydrated potassium magnesium chloride. It is variably coloured yellow to white, reddish or blue. It occurs with a sequence of potassium and magnesium evaporite. It is an uncommon double chloride mineral that forms under specific conditions. It is an important source of potash."
The wire of flash bulb is made up of:;(a) Mg;(b) Ag;(c) Cu;(d) Ba;"(a) Mg
Explanation:
Magnesium metal is used for the preparation of the wire of flash bulb."
The basic strength of which hydroxide is maximum;(a) LiOH;(b) NaOH;(c) Ca (OH)2;(d) KOH.;"(d) KOH.
Explanation:
The basic strength increases down the group and decreases along a period."
The composition of Sorels cement is;(a) KCl × MgCl2× 6H2O;(b) MgCl2 × 5MgO × (xH2O);(c) MgCO3 × CaCO3;(d) CaSO4 × 2H2O;"(b) MgCl2 × 5MgO × (xH2O)
Explanation:
Mixture of MgCl2 and MgO is called Sorels cement. It is MgCl2 × 5MgO × (xH2O)"
Which of the following alkali metals has the least melting point?;(a) Na;(b) K;(c) Rb;(d) Cs.;"(d) Cs.
Explanation:
Atomic size increases as we move down the alkali group. As a result, the binding energies of their atoms in the crystal lattice decrease. Also, the strength of metallic bonds decreases on moving down a group in the periodic table. This causes a decrease in the melting point. Among the given metals, Cs is the largest and has the least melting point."
The basic strength of which hydroxide is maximum;(a) LiOH;(b) NaOH;(c) Ca(OH)2;(d) KOH.;"(d) KOH.
Explanation:
The basic strength increases down the group and decreases along a period."
The hydration energy of Mg2+ is larger than that of;(a) A13+;(b) Na+;(c) Be26;(d) Mg3+;"(b) Na+
Explanation:
Hydration energy depends on charge of ion and ionic radius. Higher the charge, greater the hydration energy. On the other hand, smaller the size, greater the hydration energy. Charge is considered first for comparison. Hence, Mg2+ has higher hydration energy than Na+."
Milk of lime reacts with chlorine to form ________, a constituent of bleaching powder.;(a) Ca(OCI)2;(b) Ca(CIO2)2;(c) Ca(CIO3)2;(d) Ca(CIO4)2;"(a) Ca(OCI)2
Explanation:
Milk of lime reacts with chlorine to form bleaching powder.
2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 → CaCl2 + Ca(OCl)2 + 2H2O"
What happens when Calcium carbonate is heated to 1200 K?;(a) Carbon Monoxide;(b) Calcium hydroxide;(c) Calcium Oxide;(d) Both (2) and (3) are correct;"(d) Both (2) and (3) are correct
Explanation:
Calcium carbonate is strongly heated until it undergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The calcium oxide (unslaked lime) is dissolved in water to form calcium hydroxide (limewater).
CaCO3 → CaO + CO2"
The salt that is added to table salt to make it flow freely in rainy season is;(a) KCl;(b) KI;(c) Ca3(PO4)2;(d) Na3PO4;"(c) Ca3(PO4)2
Explanation:
Ca3(PO4)2. Both Ca and P are needed by human beings. Also they prevent moisture absorbing power of other components such as MgCl2, CaCl2, CaSO4 and MgSO4 present in commercial sodium chloride."
