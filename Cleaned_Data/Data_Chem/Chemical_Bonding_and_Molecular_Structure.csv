Among the following mixtures, dipole-dipole as the major interaction, is present in;(a) benzene and ethanol;(b) acetonitrile and acetone;(c) KCl and water;(d) benzene and carbon tetrachloride;"(b) acetonitrile and acetone
Explanation:
Dipole-dipole interactions occur among the polar molecules. Polar molecules have permanent dipoles. The positive pole of one molecule is thus attracted by the negative pole of the other molecule. The magnitude of dipole-dipole forces in different polar molecules is predicted on the basis of the polarity of the molecules, which in turn depends upon the electro negativities of the atoms present in the molecule and the geometry of the molecule (in case of polyatomic molecules, containing more than two atoms in a molecule)."

The maximum number of hydrogen bonds that a molecule of water can have is;(a) 1;(b) 2;(c) 3;(d) 4;"(d) 4
Explanation:
Each water molecule can form a maximum of four hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules. The two hydrogens of the water molecule can form hydrogen bonds with other oxygens in ice, and the two lone pair of electrons on oxygen of the water molecule can attract other hydrogens in ice. Hence, 4 possible hydrogen bonds."
The number of types of bonds between two carbon atoms in calcium carbide is;(a) Two sigma, two pi;(b) One sigma, two pi;(c) One sigma, one pi;(d) Two sigma, one pi;"(b) One sigma, two pi
Explanation:
A single bond between two atoms is always considered as sigma bond.
A double bond between two atoms is always considered as one sigma and one pi bond
A triple bond between two atoms is always considered as one sigma bond and two pi bonds.
So according to the given structure CaC2 (Calcium carbide) has 1 sigma and 2 pi bonds"
Based on lattice enthalpy and other considerations which one the following alkali metals chlorides is expected to have the higher melting point?;(a) RbCl;(b) KCl;(c) NaCl;(d) LiCl;"(c) NaCl
Explanation:
The highest melting point will be NaCl, it is because, the lattice energy decreases as the size of alkali metal increases so going down the group the melting point decreases, but due to the covalent bonding in LiCl, its melting point is lower than NaCl and so NaCl is expected to have maximum melting point in the alkali chlorides.​"
Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present in which of the following pairs?;(a) H2O and alcohol;(b) Cl2 and CCl4;(c) HCl and He atoms;(d) SiF4 and He atoms;"(c) HCl and He atoms

Among the following mixtures, dipole-dipole as the major interaction, is present in;(a) benzene and ethanol;(b) acetonitrile and acetone;(c) KCl and water;(d) benzene and carbon tetrachloride;"(b) acetonitrile and acetone
Explanation:
Dipole-dipole interactions occur among the polar molecules. Polar molecules have permanent dipoles. The positive pole of one molecule is thus attracted by the negative pole of the other molecule. The magnitude of dipole-dipole forces in different polar molecules is predicted on the basis of the polarity of the molecules, which in turn depends upon the electro negativities of the atoms present in the molecule and the geometry of the molecule (in case of polyatomic molecules, containing more than two atoms in a molecule)."
The charge/size ratio of a cation determines its polarizing power. Which one of the following sequences represents the increasing order of the polarizing order of the polarizing power of the cationic species, K+, Ca++, Mg2+, Be2+?;(a) Ca2+ < Mg2+ < Be+ < K+;(b) Mg2+ < Be2+ < K+ < Ca2+;(c) Be2+ < K+ < Ca2+ < Mg2+;(d) K+ < Ca2+ < Mg2+ < Be2+;"(d) K+ < Ca2+ < Mg2+ < Be2+
Explanation:
High charge and small size of the cations increases polarisation.
As the size of the given cations decreases as
K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Be2+
Hence, polarising power decreases as K+ < Ca2+ < Mg2+ < Be2+"

The outer orbitals of C in ethene molecule can be considered to be hybridized to give three equivalent sp² orbitals. The total number of sigma (s) and pi (p) bonds in ethene molecule is;(a) 1 sigma (s) and 2 pi (p) bonds;(b) 3 sigma (s) and 2 pi (p) bonds;(c) 4 sigma (s) and 1 pi (p) bonds;(d) 5 sigma (s) and 1 pi (p) bonds;"(d) 5 sigma (s) and 1 pi (p) bonds
Explanation:
According to valence bond theory, two atoms form a covalent bond through the overlap of individual half-filled valence atomic orbitals, each containing one unpaired electron. In ethene, each hydrogen atom has one unpaired electron and each carbon is sp² hybridized with one electron each sp² orbital. The fourth electron is in the p orbital that will form the pi bond. The bond order for ethene is simply the number of bonds between each atom: the carbon-carbon bond has a bond order of two, and each carbon-hydrogen bond has a bond order of one."
Which of the following is a linear molecule?;(a) ClO2;(b) CO2;(c) NO2;(d) SO2;"(b) CO2
Explanation:
The steric number of central atom of a linear molecule is two. It has two bonded atoms and zero lone pair. All the molecules have two bonded atoms. Thus, we need to work out the number of lone pairs.
In ClO2, the central atom Cl has 7 valence electrons. Four are used up to form 4 bonds with O atoms. Three are non-bonding electrons. Thus, along with an odd electron, it has a lone pair.
In CO2, the central C atom has 4 valence electrons. All are used up to form four bonds with O atoms. Thus, it has zero lone pair.
In NO2, the central N atom has 5 valence electrons. Four are used up to form bonds with oxygen atoms. Thus, one electron is left as an odd electron.
In SO2, the central S atom has 6 valence electrons. Four are used up to form bonds with oxygen atoms. Two nonbonding electrons form one lone pair."
