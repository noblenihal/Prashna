On the Paulings electronegativity scale the element next to F is;(a) N;(b) Cl;(c) O;(d) Ne.;"(c) O
Explanation:
Pauling explained electronegativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons towards it. When we analyse the trend in periodic table, we can see that the degree of electronegativity decreases while going down the groups, while it increases across the periods. In the case of a covalent bond, based on the bond energies, Pauling calculated the differences in electronegativity between atoms in the bond and assigned a value of 4 to fluorine, which is the most electronegative element, and others were calculated with respect to that value. Hence, on paulings scale, the element next to fluorine is Oxygen."

In the modern periodic table, the period indicates the value of:;(a) Atomic Number;(b) Atomic Mass;(c) Principal Quantum Number;(d) Azimuthal Quantum Number;"(c) Principal Quantum Number
Explanation:
The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.
The value of the principal quantum number (n) for the outermost shell or the valence shell indicates a period in the Modern periodic table."

Arrange S, O and Se in ascending order of electron affinity;(a) Se < S < O;(b) Se < O < S;(c) S < O < Se;(d) S < Se < O;"(a) Se < S < O
Explanation:
Correct order of electron affinity is Se < S < O. In a group electron affinity decreases with increase in atomic number."
In the modern periodic table , the period indicates the value of:;(a) Atomic Number;(b) Atomic Mass;(c) Principal Quantum Number;(d) Azimuthal Quantum Number;"(c) Principal Quantum Number
Explanation:
The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.

The reduction in atomic size with increase in atomic number is a characteristic of elements of-;(a) d−block;(b) f−block;(c) Radioactive series;(d) High atomic masses;"(b) f−block
Explanation:
The reduction in atomic size with increase in atomic number is a characteristic of elements of f- block. It is known as lanthanoid contraction and actinoid contraction. This is due to poor shielding of electrons present in f subshell."
The number of elements in the 5th period of the periodic table is;(a) 3;(b) 9;(c) 8;(d) 18;"(d) 18
Explanation:
While filling 5th shell according to Aufbau principle 5s, 5p, 4d filled so 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 electrons or elements are present in 5th shell. Further we start filling the 4d orbital which can take 10 electrons. So in the 4th principal quantum energy states, we can fill 18 electrons. Thus 5th period has 18 elements."

On the Paulings electro negativity scale the element next to F is;(a) N;(b) Cl;(c) O;(d) Ne.;"(c) O
Explanation:
Pauling explained electro negativity as the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons towards it. When we analyse the trend in periodic table, we can see that the degree of electro negativity decreases while going down the groups, while it increases across the periods. In the case of a covalent bond, based on the bond energies, Pauling calculated the differences in electro negativity between atoms in the bond and assigned a value of 4 to fluorine, which is the most electro negative element, and others were calculated with respect to that value. Hence, on paulings scale, the element next to fluorine is Oxygen."
