Explanation:
According to molecular orbital theory, each of the two boron atoms is in sp³ hybrid state. Of the four hybrid orbitals, three have one electron each while the fourth is empty. Two of the four orbitals of each of the boron atom overlap with two terminal hydrogen atoms forming two normal B – H σ-bonds. One of the remaining hybrid orbital (either filled or empty) of one of the boron atoms, 1s orbital of hydrogen atoms (bridge atom) and one of hybrid orbitals of the other boron atom overlap to form a delocalised orbital covering the three nuclei with a pair of electrons. Such a bond is known as three centre two electron (3c – 2e) bonds

Which of the following oxidation states are most characteristic for lead and tin respectively?;(a) 2, 2;(b) 4, 2;(c) 2, 4;(d) 4, 4;"(c) 2, 4
Explanation:
Due to inert pair effect, ns² electron pair of Pb does not participate in bonding. Thus, +2 is the most characteristic oxidation state for Pb. However, for Sn, the inert pair effect is not so strong Thus, +4 is the most characteristic oxidation state for Sn."
When excess of Kl is added to copper sulphate solution:;(a) Cuprous iodide is formed;(b) l2 is liberated;(c) Potassium iodide is oxidized;(d) All;"(d) All
Explanation:
It is an redox reaction which occurs when the iodide ion will reduce the copper (II) ion to copper(I) while iodide itself is oxidized to elemental iodine. Like most copper (I) compounds, Cul is insoluble in water.
KI + 2CuSO4 (aq) → Cu2l2(s) + l2(s) + 2K2SO4(aq)"
Which of the following statements regarding ozone is not correct?;(a) The oxygen-oxygen bond length in ozone is identical with that of molecular oxygen;(b) The ozone is response hybrid of two structures;(c) The ozone molecule is angular in shape;(d) Ozone is used as a germicide and disinfectant for the purification of air.;"(a) The oxygen-oxygen bond length in ozone is identical with that of molecular oxygen
Explanation:
The oxygen–oxygen bond length in ozone is identical with that of molecular oxygen"
K2[Hgl4] detect the ion/group :;(a) NH2;(b) NO;(c) NH2+;(d) Cl–;"(c) NH2+

K2[Hgl4], Nesslers reagent detects NH+4 ion."
Which of the following has least covalent P−H bond?;(a) PH+4;(b) P2H+5;(c) P2H2+6;(d) PH3;"(c) P2H2+6
Explanation:
The covalent charter of P−H bond depends on the formal charge distributed on each P−H bond
In PH+4 it is +1/4 = +0.25, in P2H+5 it is +1/5 = +0.2 and in P2H62+ it is +2/6 = +0.33.
The higher the formal charge the lesser the covalent character due to more polarisation. Thus the least covalent P−H bond is present in P2H2+64"
If Cl2 gas is passed in to aqueous solution of Kl containing some CCl4 and the mixture is shaken then:;(a) Upper layer becomes violet;(b) Lower layer becomes violet;(c) Homogenous violet layer is formed;(d) None of these;"(a) Upper layer becomes violet
Explanation:
2KI + Cl2 → 2KCl l2
I2 CCl4 → Violet Colour
But the excess of Cl2 should be avoided.
The layer may become colourless due to conversion of I2 to HIO3
I2 + 5Cl2 + 6H2O → 2HIO3 + 10HCl
In case of Br2
Br2 + 2H2O + Cl2 → 2HBrO + HCl"
Ammonia gas can be dried by;(a) conc H2SO4;(b) P2O5;(c) CaCl2;(d) Quick lime;"(c) Z and Y are F2 and B2H6 respectively

"Inert gases such as helium behave like ideal gases over a wide range of temperature .However; they condense into the solid state at very low temperatures. It indicates that at very low temperature there is a";(a) Weak attractive force between the atoms;(b) Weak repulsive force between the atoms;(c) Strong attractive force between the atoms;(d) Strong repulsive attractive between the atoms;"(c) Strong attractive force between the atoms
Explanation:
Inert gases condense into the solid state at very low temperature as there is strong attractive force between the atoms.
In solid state, Van der Waals attractive forces are predominant between the atoms. The attractive force increases with the size of the atom as a result of the increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential."
In general, the Boron Trihaides act as;(a) Strong reducing agent;(b) Lewis Acids;(c) Lewis Bases;(d) Dehydrating Agents;"(b) Lewis Acids
Explanation:
The boron atom in trihaldies has only six electrons in the valence shell and hence can accept a pair of electrons in the vacant p-orbital to complete its octet. As a result, boron trihaldies act as a Lewis acids."
On heating ozone, its volume.;(a) Increase to 1.5 times;(b) Decreases to half;(c) Remain uncharged;(d) Becomes double;"(a) Increase to 1.5 times
Explanation:
O3 → O2 + [O]
1 mole of O3 on heating produces 1 mole of O2 and 1 mole of [O], hence its volume increases to 1.5 times."
In the compound of type ECl3, where E = B, P, As, or Bi, the angle Cl – E – Cl for different E are ion the order:;(a) B > = P = As = Bi;(b) B > P > As > Bi;(c) B < P = As = Bi;(d) B < P < As < Bi;"(b) B > P > As > Bi
